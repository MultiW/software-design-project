Each group member should describe what they contributed to phase 1 in 100 words or less. Bullet points are fine.
You are encouraged to discuss this with your group.
Note that all group members will be editing the same document.
We will be checking git logs to make sure that each person is the one that commits a description of their contributions.
Part of your individual mark will depend on how much you contribute and the quality of your contributions.
